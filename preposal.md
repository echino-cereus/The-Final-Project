# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Using Ren.py to create a story. Current options include: something inspired by the Stanley Parable, 
Converting a book, something inspired by Stormlight, and converting a D&D module.

Currently leaning towards using a D&D module as a base of structure and then building off of that.

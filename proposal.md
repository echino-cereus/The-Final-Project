# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Final Project

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A visual novel telling the story of college students in a D&D University setting solving murders and disappearances. 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will run a game with different paths and options available to tell different stories. It 
Will have a character creation mini-game in the beginning (hopefully) as well as a dice-rolling mechanism to determine the success of choices.


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- a compelling story with original characters that I've designed with different choices and interactions 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- an additional mechanic of different classes the player can choose which would give them an edge and open up more options in certain situations depending on the class
- a dice-rolling mechanic

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- include character creation with different types of faces 
- include different races in character creation that will have advantages depending on the race that is chosen on ability scores 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to use Ren.py as well as create a character-creation mini-game and also how to incorporate dice rolling into the game. I will also need to learn how to draw backgrounds. I will likely need to research how to use Ren.py and how to incorporate mini-games into the story. I will have to research some specificities of the mechanics of D&D and I will need to figure out how to adapt it to the medium I am using. I might need to research good writing practices for visual novels since I have never made anything like this before. I am not working with anyone else.
